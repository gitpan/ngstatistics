NAME
    ngstatistics - Generates statistics from a local news spool

SYNOPSIS
    ngstatistics [*options*] *newsgroup*

DESCRIPTION
    NGStatistics is an advanced newsgroup statistics program. With the help
    of the *News::Scan* module, NGStatistics scans the articles in the
    newsgroup of your choice and prints various statistics from them. You
    could look at these statistics for your own amusement, or you post them
    to a newsgroup.

OPTIONS
  Debugging/Help Options

    --usage, --help, -?, -h
            Prints a short usage message, then exits.

    --verbose, -v
            Enables a few helpful debugging messages. Might also be useful
            for submitting bug reports.

            This facility is turned off by default.

    --no-post, -np
            This option specifies whether the file should be posted to the
            newgroup that's being scanned. If this option is not specified,
            then the default option will be used.

            The default option posts the message to the newsgroup.

    --emailstat, -e
            Email to statistics file to someone.

            This option is turned off by default.

    --emailaddress, -ea
            This is the 'from' Email address that will be used if the
            statistics are to be emailed. This option is only used if the
            '--emailstat' option is chosen

            The default from address is 'root@localhost'

    --emailname, -en
            This is the 'from' Email name that will be used in conjuction
            with the 'from' Email address. This option is only used if the
            '--emailstat' option is chosen

            The default from name is 'Root'

    --emailtoadd, -eta
            This is the 'to' Email address that will be used if the
            statistics are to be emailed. This option is only used if the
            '--emailstat' option is chosen

            The default to address is 'root@localhost'

    --emailtoname, -et
            This is the 'to' Email name that will be used if the statistics
            are to be emailed. This option is only used if the '--emailstat'
            option is chosen

            The default to name is 'Root'

    --confirm, -c
            This option when set will ask for confirmation before posting
            the message to the newsgroup.

            This setting has no effect if the '--no-post' option is set.

            The default is that the message is posted to the group.

  Scan Options

    --days  Sets the number of days in the past NGStatistics should scan.

            The default is one week (i.e. 7 days). See the section on
            "NOTES".

    --ranklarge, -l
            Sets the number of items printed in the 'major' categories.

            Both of the 'Posters' and 'Threads' categories are considered
            major.

            The default is 25.

    --ranksmall, -s
            Sets the number of items printed in the 'minor' categories.

            Both of the 'Original Content Ratings' categories and the
            crossposting category are considered minor.

            The default is 10.

  Formatting Options

    --width, -w
            Sets the width of the printed lines in columns.

            The default is 72 and should be acceptable for most purposes.

    --headstrip, -H
            This option enables the use of the "headstrip" routine. This
            routine attempts to remove the email address from poster names
            before printing out results. If you do not want this, or if your
            *Mail::Address* module is buggy, then set this option to off

            The default is on.

  Input Options

    --spool-base, -s
            Sets the base directory of your local news spool. This specifies
            the root of your spool, not the exact directory where articles
            are stored.

            The default is: */var/spool/news*

    --dotted, -d
            Replace '.' with '/' in newsgroup names. This only applies when
            using the --spool-base option.

            The default is to do the replacement.

  Output Options

    --output-file, -of
            Specifies a single file to store statistics in.

            The default is set to *output-file*

ENVIRONMENT
    NGStatistics reads the contents of the environmental variable "NGSTATS"
    on startup. If you want to set default options for this program, put
    them here. They will be read as if they were normal command line
    options.

    Default variables can also be set by editing this script at the start.

    NGStatistics also makes use of the "HOME" variable to determine where to
    place output files in the event that the --output-file option was
    specified.

EXAMPLES
    Scan 'rec.arts.drwho' from seven days ago until now, getting articles
    from "/var/spool/news", putting the output file into "/News/STATS":

            ngstatistics --group rec.arts.drwho -of=/News/STATS

    Scan 'rec.arts.drwho' from seven days ago until now, getting articles
    from "/var/spool/news", putting the output file into "/News/STATS", do
    not post them, but email them to 'toto@toto.com' from 'toto2@toto.com',
    where both the email to and from names are 'Toto'. Also use the verbose
    and confirm options:

            ngstatistics --group rec.arts.drwho -of=/News/STATS -np -e
            -en Toto -emailaddress toto@toto.com -eta toto2@toto.com -et Toto
            -v -c

    Scan three days of 'alt.sysadmin.recovery', getting articles from
    "/tmp/asr" and putting output into "/tmp/asr-stats.txt":

            ngstatistics --spool-base=/tmp/asr -of=/tmp/asr-stats.txt 
            --group alt.sysadmin.recovery

    Scan the top 50's for 'news.admin.net-abuse.usenet' with default
    options:

            ngstatistics -N50 -n50 --group news.admin.net-abuse.usenet

NOTES
    In order to use the --days option, you must have that many days of
    articles in your 'spool-base'. If you don't, NGStatistics will not
    correct your error and the stats will be skewed. This means that if you
    want to use the default, you must have *at least* a week's worth of
    articles on spool.

    If you are constantly resetting the defaults, you may want to define the
    "NGSTATS" environmental variable.

    In ~/.bashrc (Unix platforms):

            export NGSTATS=options

    In AUTOEXEC.BAT (M$-DoS type systems):

            SET NGSTATS=options

    You can also edit the default options by modifying the start of the
    script.

WARNINGS
    If you post statistics about a newsgroup to that newsgroup on a regular
    basis, you may end up starting a series of everlasting flamewars. Be
    warned!

BUGS
    Still quite a few. Email me with any bugs that you find at:
