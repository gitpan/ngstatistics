NGStatistics TODO List
======================

These are features that I believe need to be added.

Last updated: 14 August, 2002.

* Add facility to scan more than one news group.
* Add MIME support.
* Find a way to filter "joke" groups from the crossposting stats.
  This may be a bit difficult, as the newsgroups list varies from
  server to server. (Will try to do this based on current spool)
* Give statistics based upon certain keywords in the subject/body.
* Give the option to post additional text when posting to a newsgroup.
* Tidy the script up as it's starting to get messy

Things that have been finished:
* Addtional confirmation messages added before posting.
* Option to post or not to post.
* Verbose option expanded.
* Should work on Windoze.
* Added facility to email results to people.
